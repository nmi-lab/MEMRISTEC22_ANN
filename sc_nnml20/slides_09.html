        <ul>
          <li/> Almost all real-world data has a time-like dimension: For example:
            <ul>
              <li />Videos
                <img src="images/video_data.png" class=vsmall />

                <img src="images/pos.png" class=vsmall />
            </ul>

          <li class=fragment /> So Time is just another dimension, like channels in images. But what is special about it?

        <h2> How to Deal with Variable-Sized Dimensions?</h2>                                                     
        <ul>
          <li/> Time is a variable dimension. Until now, we dealt with data having static dimensions. There are two ways to deal with this:
          <ol>
          <li class=fragment /> Fix the size, truncate (pad) the data that has a larger (smaller) dimension. For example for size 2:
            <ul>
              <li/> Three data samples: [[1, 5, 6], [3,4], [3]] $\rightarrow$ [[1, 5], [3,4], [3, None]]
              <li /> Once the size is fixed, a feed-forward neural network can be used
            </ul>
            
          <li class=fragment /> Use a recursive algorithm: Feed in the data time step by time step and keep a memory of the previously fed data samples
            <ul>
              <li/> [[1, 5, 6], [3,4], [3]] $\rightarrow$ [[1,3,3],[5,4, -],[3,-, -]
              <li /> - is a special symbol means end-of-sequence. Recurrent neural networks are designed to deal with such data
            </ul>
          </ol>
        </ul>

          <li/> A simple recurrent network is simply a network whose output feeds back to itself
          <li/> Memory fades exponentially in time, and so RNNs have limited use cases. They are useful to understand the challenges of training RNNs.

        <ul>
          <li /> We would like to leverage the GPUs parallel capability through batches (as we always did)
          <li class=fragment /> But tensors cannot have variable sizes, i.e. [[2,3,4], [3,4]] cannot be stored as a tensor
          <li class=fragment /> We need to pad the data: [[2,3,4], [3,4,None]] and let PyTorch know that the GPU process should not do anything when None is encountered.
            <li class=fragment /> This requires padding, and packing sequences and involves some coding (we won't do it in this class)

          <li/> RNNs capture dependencies across a sequence (e.g. across "time")
          <li/> RNNs are trained by "unrolling them", making them equivalent to Feedforward networks, with "tied" weights.
          <li/> Training RNNs is difficult because sequence length translate into depth
          <li/> Truncated BPTT can overcome this difficulty, but at the cost of long-term dependencies
