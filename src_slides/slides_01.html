        <ul>
          <li /> The goal of Machine Learning (ML) is to learn to solve a problem by extracting patterns from raw data 
          <li class=fragment /> The performance of ML models depends heavily on the representation of the data
          <li class=fragment /> Neural Networks are particularly efficient at learning these representations  
        </ul>
